        "* Definition: As discussed in the first question, methods are functions defined inside a class. They are associated with the objects (instances) of that class.\n",

        "# 7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "-> Using generators in Python offers several significant advantages over regular functions, especially when dealing with sequences of data:\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) Memory Efficiency (Lazy Evaluation):-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Regular Functions: If a regular function needs to return a sequence of values, it typically creates the entire sequence (e.g., a list) in memory before returning it. This can be very memory-intensive, especially for large sequences or when dealing with potentially infinite streams of data.\n",
        "* Generators: Generators produce values one at a time, only when they are requested (lazy evaluation). They don't store the entire sequence in memory. This makes them incredibly memory-efficient for large datasets or when you only need to process a few items from a potentially vast sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) Improved Performance (Potentially):-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Regular Functions: May perform unnecessary computations if not all the generated values are actually used.\n",
        "* Generators: Only compute values when they are needed.1 If you break out of a loop early or only consume a portion of the generated sequence, the generator stops producing values, saving computation time.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iii) Simpler and More Readable Code for Iteration:-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Regular Functions (for iterators): To create a custom iterator using a regular function, you would typically need to manage the state explicitly (e.g., using class attributes and __iter__, __next__ methods). This can be more verbose and error-prone.\n",
        "* Generators: Generator functions provide a more natural and concise way to define iterative behavior using the yield keyword. The function's state is automatically managed between yield calls, making the code easier to write and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iv) Ability to Represent Infinite Sequences:-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Regular Functions: Cannot practically represent infinite sequences as they would require infinite memory to store the results.\n",
        "* Generators: Can easily represent and iterate over infinite sequences because they only produce the next value when asked. You can implement logic that generates values indefinitely.\n",
        "\n",
        "(v) Pipeline Processing:-\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators can be easily chained together to form processing pipelines. One generator can consume the output of another generator, performing a series of operations on the data in a memory-efficient way. This is similar to how pipes work in Unix-like systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "-> In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) Definition:-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Lambda functions are defined using the lambda keyword.\n",
        "* They can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.\n",
        "* The result of the expression is returned.\n",
        "(ii) Syntax:-\n",
        "\n",
        "* lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "\n",
        "(iii) Typical Uses:-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Short, Simple Operations: Lambda functions are ideal for concise, one-line functions.\n",
        "* Higher-Order Functions: They're frequently used as arguments to higher-order functions like:\n",
        "     map(): Applies a function to each item in an iterable.\n",
        "     filter(): Creates a new iterable with items that pass a test.\n",
        "     sorted(): Sorts an iterable based on a key function.\n",
        "* Event Handlers: In some GUI frameworks or event-driven programming, they can be used for simple event handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iv) Key Characteristics:-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Anonymous: They don't have a name (unless assigned to a variable).\n",
        "* Concise: They offer a compact way to define functions.\n",
        "* Limited to One Expression: They can only contain a single expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "-> The map() function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to apply a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and returns an iterator that yields the results. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) Purpose:-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Applying a function to each element: The primary purpose of map() is to streamline the process of performing the same operation on every item within an iterable.\n",
        "* Concise code: It provides a more compact and often more efficient alternative to traditional for loops when you need to transform elements in an iterable.\n",
        "* Creating iterators: map() returns a map object, which is an iterator. This means it generates the results on demand, which can be beneficial for memory management, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) Usage:-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Syntax:\n",
        " -: map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
        " -: function: The function to apply to each item.\n",
        " -: iterable: The iterable (e.g., list, tuple) to process.\n",
        " -: You can also pass multiple iterables if your function requires it.\n",
        "* How it works:\n",
        "i) map() takes a function and one or more iterables as input.\n",
        "II) It applies the given function to each element of the iterable(s).\n",
        "III) It returns a map object (an iterator) containing the results.\n",
        "* Common use cases:\n",
        " -: Transforming elements: For example, converting a list of strings to uppercase, or squaring a list of numbers.\n",
        "-: Working with lambda functions: map() is often used in conjunction with lambda functions for concise, one-line transformations.\n",
        "-: Processing data: It's useful for applying data cleaning or manipulation functions to elements in a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "-> map(), reduce(), and filter() are all built-in functions in Python that operate on iterables, but they serve distinct purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. map():\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator yielding the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformation: It transforms each element of the iterable based on the provided function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: Returns a map object (an iterator), which can be converted to other iterable types like lists or tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage:\n",

        "Transforming elements (e.g., squaring numbers, converting strings to uppercase).\n",
        "Applying a function to each item in a collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. filter():\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Creates an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns True.\n",
        "\n",
        "Selection: It filters elements based on a condition defined by the provided function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: Returns a filter object (an iterator) containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "Selecting elements that meet a specific criteria (e.g., filtering even numbers, selecting strings with a certain length).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. reduce():\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, to reduce the iterable to a single value.\n",
        "Aggregation: It combines elements of the iterable into a single result.\n",
        "\n",

        "Usage:\n",
